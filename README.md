# SecondHand - The first free used clothing shopping assistant 
SecondHand is my attempt to build a personal shopping assistant for used clothing. This service will take user inputs such as size, brands, price, shoe size, and height, and scrape used clothing websites using this information to return ads that could be of interest. Some examples of websites it can look at include:

1. Poshmark: A platform for buying and selling gently used clothing, shoes, and accessories.
2. Depop: A social shopping app that allows users to buy and sell secondhand clothing and other items.
3. ThredUp: An online thrift store that sells gently used clothing, shoes, and accessories for women, men, and children.
4. eBay: A global online marketplace where you can buy and sell a wide variety of items, including used clothing.
5. ASOS Marketplace: A platform for buying and selling vintage and pre-owned clothing, shoes, and accessories from independent brands and sellers.
6. Grailed: A marketplace for buying and selling high-end menswear, including vintage and gently used clothing.
7. Vinted: A platform for buying and selling secondhand clothing, shoes, and accessories for women, men, and children.
8. The RealReal: An online and brick-and-mortar marketplace that specialized in selling gently used and authenticated luxury clothing, shoes, and accessories.
9. Rebag: A platform for buying and selling pre-owned designer handbags.
10. Tradesy: A marketplace for buying and selling gently used designer clothing, shoes, and accessories.

These websites allow you to search for specific items or browse through their selection of used clothing. Some of these websites may also have features that allow you to set alerts or notifications for when certain items become available.

# Problem
As a secondhand clothing shopper, there are too many mediums to buy secondhand clothes on. An example list of some of these websites can be seen above. It is time consuming to browse through all these websites individually.

# Solution 
Build a service that does the shopping for you. This service will take inputs from the user and scrape these online stores for secondhand clothing listings. It will consider the brand, size, and price to bring the user exactly what they are looking for.

# Why
This product allows for the user to reduce the total time spent shopping. It brings the clothing that they went directly to them without having to do the work. This also provides an opportunity to connect with sellers, who could potentially bring you more business in the future.

# Who
The output will be clothing listings that fall into the input constraints you are looking for.

# Medium 
The medium for this service could include a website and/or app for the user to use. There also is a possibility to send listings via email, in order to reduce the need for the front-end interface. 

# Competitors
Currently unable to find a service of this kind. Some websites allow the user to input what they are looking for (brands, sizes) however that is only specific to that company.

# Target Market 
All online secondhand shoppers. The secondhand market is growing at a rapid rate, with target markets mainly residing in North America, Europe, and Asia. 
A good resource I found that goes over the growth of this market is discussed in this article: https://www.thredup.com/resale/#size-and-impact
