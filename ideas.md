Steps for development

1) Working webscraper with workable data 
    - this means no error codes when reaching websites 
    - experiment on generic websites first, then navigate to websites of interest (used clothing websites) 

2) Using GPSE (Google Programmable Search Engine) for basic searches 
    - Can search keywords on GSE easily
    - Can be done on used and new clothing
    - Maybe could search google shopping? With used/new keywords for different purposes? 
    - How can we extract that information?
    - Could use schedule library to schedule exactly when this script runs
